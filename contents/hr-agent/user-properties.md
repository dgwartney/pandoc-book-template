## User Properties

User properties are pieces of information specific to a user that permits the ability to customize the
agent responses to the user. For example, a user conversation with an agent in India versus
the United States may differ on topics of Human Resources due to local labor laws or policies.

The exercises for this lesson will provide the mechanics of the creation of user properties that will be used in
a virtual assistant in later lessons.

In our specific case will be creating three user properties:

- Location
- Title

### Exercise: Adding a New User Property

- Open the new virtual agent you created in the previous lesson

- Navigate to **Agent -> Configuration -> User Properties**

- Click on the _Create_ button to create the new user property

### Exercise: Adding additional User Properties

Add two additional properties using the method provided in the previous lesson with the values here:

- _Name_ is `Title`, _Key_ is `title`

With our user properties defined continue the next step.
