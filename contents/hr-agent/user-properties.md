## User Properties

User properties that provide personalized information about a user that are used to customize the
agent responses to the user. For example, a user conversation with an agent in Germany versus
the United States may differ on topics of human resources due to local labor laws or policies.

The exercises for this lesson will show to create user property that will be used in
a virtual assistant in later lessons.

In our specific case will be creating a user property `Location`
