### Exercise: Default Smalltalk Skill

Smalltalk is a form of Q&A skill that allows you to build a personality for your agent
to represent the organization. It can be used across agents developed by the organization.
Smalltalk has lesser priority as compared to Q&A skill.

Examples for smalltalk questions are:

>> _Who built you?_
>>
>> _Who is your CEO?_
>>
>> _Which is your favourite sports team?_

Open the smalltalk skill in the skill builder and see what questions are already answered.
Create a list of questions and answers that would want your agent to answer.
